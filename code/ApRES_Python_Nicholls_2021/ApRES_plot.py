"""
Function to plot ApRES data

ApRES_plot('fn',<filename>,'bl',<burstlist>,'cl',<chirplist>,'md',<maxdepth>,'po',<plot options>)
    <plot options> = string containing all or none of 'c','a','r','t'
    'c': plot individual chirps (if absent, plot mean of chirps)
    'a': plot depth profiles, averaged unless "c" included as a plot option
         If no other options, "a" is assumed by default
    'r': plot raw bursts as time series
    't': plot chirp time series, averaged unless "c" included as a plot option
    
    <filename>  filename to plot, including complete path from current folder.
                If no filename given, a file-browser window is displayed.
                
    <burstlist> is either -1 (default) or a Python list of bursts to plot,
                starting at burst 0. -1 means plot all bursts. Each burst is
                plotted in a different figure window
                
    <chirplist> is either -1 (default) or a Python list of chirps within bursts
                to plot, starting at chirp 0. -1 means plot all chirps. Chirps
                from within each burst are either averaged (default) or, if
                plot option "c" is selected, overplotted.
    <maxdepth>  is maximum depth to plot in metres
